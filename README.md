#### Welcome to my public data analytics projects page

Here I share analytics on a wide varity of topics and methods that I find interesting and I hope you do as well.

When I'm not using my analytics and finance skills at my full time job, I assist non-profit organizations with data analytics projects, data infrastructure and training.
